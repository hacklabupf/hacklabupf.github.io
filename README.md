# HackLab
This is intended to be a web to help the life in the hacklab of UPF (Universitat Pompeu Fabra).

## Getting started
- Install `node` in your computer and clone the repo.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Watch the folder with a localserver and run `npm start`.

The `src` folder is the source where you should edit the files. `gulp` minifies the files and places everything into the `dist` folder. I recommend to navigate the `dist` folder with the localserver and run `gulp -p` each time in order to deploy.
