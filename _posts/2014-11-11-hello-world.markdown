Finally, we can start this experimental coordination web that is expected to improve the relation between us, learn and share.

The design of this web is simple. Prepared to be collaborative/cooperative with a immediately read/write approach. It means that for every defined menu item, it can written through a simple javascript editor and it will be immediately published in the web. New menu items can be suggested. Participation is welcome.

hacklabupf project started few weeks ago, and there are different workgroups and projects associated:

- Guifi.net: [http://guifi.net/en/node/56604](http://guifi.net/en/node/56604)
- Hands-on Wireless Sensor Networks: [http://handsonwsn.org/]([http://handsonwsn.org/])
- ACM-UPF 2014 Contest (programming workshop): [http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~jonsson/acm/](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~jonsson/acm/)
- Workgroup about robots: [http://github.com/hacklabupf/robot](http://github.com/hacklabupf/robot)

Some actions around robotics, in the intersection of ICT and journalism or around game design are in the process of being conceptualised.
